# Memo date placeholder notes

## Issue summary
- Observed `{date}` placeholder leaking into LLM requests generated by the memo processor script and Android client.
- Root cause: prompt templating replaced `{today}` but never substituted `{date}`, leaving raw braces in runtime requests.

## Fix tasks
1. **Android** – Cache today's ISO string once per request and substitute both `{today}` and `{date}` in `MemoProcessor.kt` to keep the on-device prompt consistent.
2. **Scripts** – Mirror the Android change by injecting today's ISO string for `{today}` and `{date}` within `scripts/notes_tools/memo_processing.py`, plus add regression coverage that asserts the placeholders are gone.

## Follow-up
- Confirmed test coverage via `scripts/tests/test_notes_tools.py` to guard against future regressions.
